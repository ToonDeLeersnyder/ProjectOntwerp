# PCB design
## About The Project
For the task of Project Ontwerpen i have chosen to create the Microsupply from one of the Elektor tech-books.
As task we need to design a scheme in altium  where we put all the parts and connect them together.
We also need to purchase our parts ourself.


this is what my project is based off.
